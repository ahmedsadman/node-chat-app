# NodeChat
> LIVE: https://nodechat211.herokuapp.com

An instant public messaging web application, made with NodeJS, Express and Socket.io (mainly for learning purpose). Instantly start chatting with friends without any registration hassle. Features include

- Instant messaging
- Room creation
- See active rooms and join as you like
- Location sharing

This was mainly a project from a tutorial series. I added extra feature upon it (active room monitoring) and published it so that other users can also learn from it.
